        <p>I am from KvÃ¦nangen/SkjervÃ¸y in Northern Norway, recently turned 25, and right now I am in my third year of the five
        year master's
        programme in design at <a href="https://aho.no/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Oslo School of
        Architecture and Design</a> while working with <a href="https://www.openbridge.no/" target="_blank"
        rel="external">OpenBridge</a>, an open-source design system for better and safer user interfaces on ships, aiming to reduce the carbon emissions in the
        ocean industry by helping ship operators make energy-efficient decisions.</p>
        
        <p>Previously I have worked with <a href="https://www.seam.no" target="_blank" rel="external">SEAM</a> and designed user
        interfaces for alarm systems at their electric ferries, as a part of my current position as a student assistant at <a
        href="https://www.oicl.no/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ocean Industries Concept Lab</a>. During the summer of
        2022 I worked at <a href="https://www.bigfish.no" target="_blank" rel="external">Big Fish</a>, where I made social
        media content for <a href="https://www.becour.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Becour</a> and helped design a
        new landing page for <a href="https://www.becour.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Marbly</a>, a platform that makes
        it easier for companies to source renewable energy.</p>
        
        <p>As a child I enjoyed taking photos, which
        sparked my interest for design and
        technology later on. I learned to code when I was 10, and at 19 I started my first job as a web designer/developeÃ§r,
        after finishing my craft certificate in digital media design. I worked in TromsÃ¸ for a couple of years, before I
        decided to do a master's degree in interaction design, and moved to Oslo to become a full-time design student.

        <p>When I am not at school working on design projects or designing components in Figma, you can probably find me in the stable, outside hiking in the forest, at a cafÃ©
        sipping oat latte and writing something in my Moleskine, or maybe at
        a concert somewhere headbanging to a rock or metal band.</p>
