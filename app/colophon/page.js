    <h2>Colophon <BlockIcon>‚úèÔ∏è</BlockIcon></h2>
    <p>For the past 8 years this website has served as my own personal sandbox for learning new technologies and maintaining my coding skills. This version is using <a href="https://rsms.me/inter" target="_blank" rel="external">Inter Display</a> for the text, a JSON-file for the content, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a> to display everything on the front-end. The site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a>. The code is written without the assistant of an AI.</p>
    
    <h3>AI usage <BlockIcon>ü§ñ</BlockIcon></h3>
    <p>I have not used generative AI for the content on this website. Not only because I prefer to use my own brain and creativity, but also because the Large Language Models (LLMs) are associated with high energy consumption and water usage. Even though some LLMs are more or less running on renewable energy, they still require a lot of resources, which I do not believe is worth it when it comes to dealing with everyday problems. For instance, one single prompt in ChatGPT might require up to 15 times more energy than a Google search*.</p>

    <p>The LLMs are running on servers, and when the servers are getting hot, they need water to cool down. Because of the high temperatures, the water is evaporated and can not be reused. The training of OpenAI might have required <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271" rel="external" target="_blank">700 000 liters of fresh water</a>, according to a research report. Clean drinking water is one of the most precious resources on Earth, and it is being used to run LLMs like OpenAI and Gemini, so that we do not have to think for ourselves.</p>

    <h3>Carbon footprint <BlockIcon>üåç</BlockIcon></h3>
    <p>The Internet requires energy, which leads to carbon emissions. According to <a href="    https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">websitecarbon.com</a>, the average website produces about 0,5 gram of CO2 per page view. To reduce the carbon emissions, we should create fast websites that consumes less resources. Normal websites are built each time they are loaded, but using modern technology we can make sure they are only built once.</p>
    
    <p>For this website, I have made sure to keep the design simple and minimize the amount of images and videos. The images are compressed and adapted to the screen resolution. Hosting the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a> means that it is running on sustainable energy. And of course, this site is using a modern Javascript framework (<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a>), which means it is only built when I publish any changes.</p>
